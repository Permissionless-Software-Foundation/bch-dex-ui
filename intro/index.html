    <h1>BCH DEX</h1>
    <h2>Read Before Entering:</h2>
    <p>
      The BCH DEX is a decentralized network for
      trading <a href="https://simpleledger.cash/" target="_blank">SLP tokens</a> on
      the Bitcoin Cash blockchain.
      Clicking the button below will take you to a <b>read-only</b> demo. You can
      not trade tokens, but can only view the tokens listed for sale on the
      network.
    </p>

    </center>

    <h2>Optional Information:</h2>
    <p>
      The BCH DEX is still in its prototyping phase. The code is rough and prone
      to bugs. Keep this in mind, and check your expectations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The DEX is <b>not</b> intended to be operated as a typical '.com' website. It's
      intended to be operated by individuals, in the comfort of their own home,
      on a standard computer
      or <a href="https://amzn.to/3793M6A" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a>. To
      start trading and to
      find out more, check out
